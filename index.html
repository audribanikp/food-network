                <h3>Delicious Almond Joy Energy Bites</h3>
                <p>These might look like unassuming energy bites but they’re not. They’re kind of exceptional (but shhh,
                    don’t tell). Not only do they pack all of the flavors of Almond Joy inside (hello chocolate,
                    coconut, almond!), but they also have the texture of a no-bake cookie. WE KNOW. It’s a big deal.</p>

                <h3>Easy Roasted POtato Salad with Garlic Dill Dressing</h3>
                <p>We roasted the potatoes for crispy edges and tender center, then tossed in the zingy garlic dill
                    sauce. Needless to say, this roasted potato salad was a crowd favorite and the rest is history. The
                    best part? Just 7 simple pantry staples required for this delicious side or snack. Let us show you
                    how it’s done!</p>

                <h3>Easy Vegan Paella (1 pan!) </h3>
                <p>If you think paella is too difficult to make, think again! This one pan wonder is surprisingly
                    approachable, incredibly flavorful, and customizable based on taste and season. We couldn’t help but
                    add some vegan chorizo (check out our recent recipe here) for even more substance. </p>
